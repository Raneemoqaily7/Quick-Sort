# Quick-Sort

# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
 Trace the algorithm by stepping through the process by imolementt Quick-Sort with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Time complexities:
O(n2): This occurs when the pivot element selected is the shortest or the largest
O(n*log n): This occurs when the pivot element is the middle element.
Space complexity: O(log n)
